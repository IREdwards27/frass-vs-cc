# frass-vs-cc
Comparing phenology patterns between frass observation and Caterpillars Count! observations.

This repo contains data and code for the purpose of analyzing patterns in caterpillar phenology.

This project will focus on comparing observed caterpillar phenology patterns based on the contents of frass traps and observed phenology based on observations of caterpillars from the Caterpillars Count! citizen science project.
